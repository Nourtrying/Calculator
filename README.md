# Calculator
Calculator created with HTML, CSS and JS. Maybe I will include Bootsrap in the future.

This project was part of The Odin Project curriculum.

Through this project, I was able to implement what I learnt, I mainly used javascript to add numbers and operations button. And I also had more practice with CSS especially with Flexbox.
